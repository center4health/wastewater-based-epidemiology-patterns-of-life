# Wastewater Based Epidemiology Patterns of Life

This repository contains code and supporting resources for analyzing wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) data using patterns of life simulation. The goal is to extract population level signals from wastewater measurements and relate them to temporal and spatial human mobility patterns.

## Overview

Wastewater based epidemiology provides a non invasive way to monitor public health at scale. By combining wastewater signals with patterns of life modeling, this project aims to improve interpretation of trends, anomalies, and behavioral effects in communities.

Because these controls can be adjusted independently, the same simulation framework can be reparameterized for another city or institution without changing the model structure. In this study, we use one reproducible configuration to evaluate the effects of mobility and defecation behavior on wastewater signals. Full census-level calibration of Fulton County is left for future work.
