# Wastewater Based Epidemiology Patterns of Life

This repository contains code and supporting resources for analyzing wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) data using patterns of life simulation. The goal is to extract population level signals from wastewater measurements and relate them to temporal and spatial human mobility patterns.

## Overview

Wastewater based epidemiology provides a non invasive way to monitor public health at scale. By combining wastewater signals with patterns of life modeling, this project aims to improve interpretation of trends, anomalies, and behavioral effects in communities.
